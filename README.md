# Online Shopping Web - RESTful API

The Online Shopping Web - RESTful API project is focused on providing a robust and efficient backend solution for an online shopping platform. This project specifically caters to the creation of RESTful APIs to facilitate various e-commerce functionalities.

The project's primary objective is to develop a set of APIs that enable seamless interaction between the frontend and backend components of an online shopping website. These APIs are responsible for handling essential operations, including product listing, product details, cart management, order processing, user authentication, and more.

The backend of the application is developed using modern technologies and frameworks, such as Spring Boot, to ensure scalability, performance, and maintainability. The Spring Boot framework simplifies the development process, allowing for quick creation of RESTful APIs and integration with other necessary components.

The Online Shopping Web - RESTful API project focuses solely on the backend development and does not include a frontend implementation. This approach allows for flexibility, as developers can choose their preferred frontend technologies and frameworks to consume the provided APIs.

The project aims to create a scalable and efficient API solution for online shopping purposes. It provides the necessary foundation for building a full-fledged online shopping web application by enabling seamless data exchange between the frontend and backend components.

Please note that the project is focused on the backend API development, and integration with a frontend application is required to create a complete online shopping experience. The repository welcomes contributions from the open-source community to enhance the project and deliver a reliable and feature-rich backend solution for online shopping.
